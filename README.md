# Sketch-to-Image Generation Android App  
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE) [![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Android-green.svg)](https://developer.android.com/)  

## üì± Overview  
This project is an Android application that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to transform hand-drawn sketches into photorealistic images. Developed in Java, the app integrates a deep learning-based model for sketch-to-image generation with a user-friendly interface, making it a powerful tool for artists, designers, and enthusiasts.  

## ‚ú® Features  
- **Sketch-to-Image Transformation:** Convert sketches into detailed and realistic images.  
- **User-Friendly Drawing Canvas:** Built-in canvas for drawing sketches directly within the app.  
- **Upload Support:** Import pre-drawn sketches from your device.  
- **Real-Time Preview:** View results dynamically as you refine your sketches.  
- **Export Results:** Save the generated images to your gallery or share them on social media.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **Language:** Java  
- **Platform:** Android Studio  
- **Framework:** TensorFlow Lite (for on-device model inference)  
- **Model:** GAN-based (trained separately and integrated as a TFLite model)  
- **Design:** XML layouts with Material Design principles  

## üöÄ Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Android Studio installed on your system.  
- A device/emulator running Android 7.0 (API Level 24) or higher.  

### Installation Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  

2. Open the project in Android Studio.  

3. Sync Gradle and resolve dependencies.  

4. Build and run the app on an emulator or connected device.  

### Model Setup  
- The app uses a TensorFlow Lite model (`sketch_to_image.tflite`).  
- Place the model file in the `assets` folder under `src/main/`.  

### Usage  
1. Launch the app and start drawing on the canvas or upload a sketch from your device.  
2. Tap the **Generate** button to see your sketch transformed into a realistic image.  
3. Save or share the generated image directly from the app.  

## üåü Future Improvements  
- **Dynamic Model Updates:** Allow users to download new models for diverse generation styles.  
- **Multilingual Support:** Add localization for broader accessibility.  
- **Enhanced Realism:** Integrate state-of-the-art models for better outputs.  
- **Batch Processing:** Enable multiple sketch uploads for simultaneous processing.
